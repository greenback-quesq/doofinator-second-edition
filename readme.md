# Doof-inator: second edition
What is a Doof-inator? Gosh! It was ridiculous!
This is a open-source jukebox. If you haven't tried the original repository, it is written in C++ (not his favourite language). This is my first time using Github's Copilot AI thingamajing, to create a multi-platform jukebox.
## What other perks shall I inculde in this jukebox?
Don't know. Maybe... API integration?
